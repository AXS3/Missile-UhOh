# Missiles-Ohno
With the new ballistic missile, you can nuke the enemies with various missile silos. (It's also my first mod)

## Factory
Adds a Ballistics Factory to create missiles to load various milos. Kinda expensive to run, so have fun with that

## Silos (and version added)
##### Missile Silo (v1) - Fires basic missiles. Missiles travel slightly faster.
##### Air Mine Silo (v1) - Fires a missile that bursts into a field of air mines.
##### Anti-Air Silo (v1) - Fires much faster missiles that blast down flying enemies
##### Splitter Silo (v1) - Fire missiles that split into multiple smaller missiles. Thrice.
##### Nuclear Silo (v1) - The destruction capable should be read from the name
