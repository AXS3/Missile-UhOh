description: "With the new [#8f0101]Ballistic Missile[], you can nuke the enemies with various missile silos. Note: Missile launchers are extremely expensive and time consuming to build. I recommend using the 250% build speed on the Trident Bomber and Phantom Builders."
version: "2.18"
//I increase the version number every time I make a new test version, no matter how wsmall the change
